## What dbskill helps you solve

You do not need to learn a complex methodology first, or know which tool to invoke. Give `/dbs` your current business situation, material, decision, or blocker. It selects the relevant Skill from the conversation context.

| Situation | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| Customers say your offer is expensive | Business diagnosis, risks, and validation actions |
| You have a topic but cannot turn it into watchable content | Content direction, hooks, titles, and script improvements |
| You know what to do but cannot move forward | Analysis of the blocker and one concrete starting action |
| You keep facing similar decisions without accumulating experience | Decision records, patterns, and snapshots |
| Your drafts, topics, and cases are scattered | A maintainable content-asset project |

## Quick start

After installation, enter this in your Agent:

```text
/dbs I run coding classes for children. I have 40 paid students, but renewals are low.
Help me determine whether the issue is the product, pricing, or customer segment.
```

`/dbs` reads the current conversation and selects an appropriate path. Add new facts or feedback after a round, then call `/dbs` again to determine what to work on next.

When you already know the task, call a Skill directly:

```text
/dbs-diagnosis I offer home-organization consulting for mothers. Clients say it is expensive. What should I change?
/dbs-content I want to discuss “ordinary people should not rush into building a personal brand.” How can I turn this into content?
/dbs-hook Here are the first 20 seconds of my video script. Improve the opening: …
/dbs-benchmark I want to study enterprise-service content accounts. Which benchmarks should I research?
```

## Capabilities

| Goal | Main Skills | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Evaluate a business, product, price, or customer | `/dbs-diagnosis` | Diagnosis, risks, validation plan |
| Find and study benchmarks | `/dbs-benchmark` | Benchmark shortlist and research framework |
| Find recurring solutions in structurally analogous historical cases | `/dbs-standard-answer` | Case matrix, conditional answer, and failure boundaries |
| Create topics, content, titles, and videos | `/dbs-content`, `/dbs-hook`, `/dbs-xhs-title` | Direction and publishable copy |
| Review resonance, logic, and reach | `/dbs-resonate`, `/dbs-script-flow`, `/dbs-spread` | Prioritized edits |
| Clarify concepts, goals, and questions | `/dbs-deconstruct`, `/dbs-goal`, `/dbs-good-question` | Testable definitions and goals |
| Work through procrastination and execution blocks | `/dbs-action`, `/dbs-slowisfast` | Blocker analysis and next action |
| Record and review long-term decisions | `/dbs-decision`, `/dbs-save`, `/dbs-restore`, `/dbs-report` | Local decision archive and reports |
| Build content assets and multi-Agent workflows | `/dbs-content-system`, `/dbs-agent-migration`, `/dbs-bridge` | Local project, topic map, and bridge plan |
| Turn a local folder into a knowledge base | `/dbs-knowledge` | Knowledge navigation, version rules, and ready-to-use prompts |
| Audit local Skill risks | `/dbs-skill-cleaner` | Risk report and confirmed isolation |

See the [full guide and Skill directory](docs/新手入门.md#skill-全目录) for all 29 Skills, examples, and workflows.

## Install

### Doubao, WorkBuddy, Codex, and other Agents supporting Skills

Run in a terminal:

```bash
npx -y skills add dontbesilent2025/dbskill -g --all
```

Return to your Agent and enter `/dbs 新手入门` to begin.

### Claude Code marketplace

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add dontbesilent2025/dbskill
claude plugin install dbs@dontbesilent-skills
```

![Claude Code installation demo](demo.gif)

### Update

Ask your current Agent:

```text
更新 dbskill
```

This syncs the official dbskill and does not modify records, reports, or decisions under `~/.dbs/`. See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/dontbesilent2025/dbskill/releases) for changes.

## How it works

```text
A real task
   ↓
/dbs reads context and selects the current entry point
   ↓
One Skill produces a diagnosis, output, or record
   ↓
Add results and feedback, then decide the next step
```

## Knowledge base and local records

The repository includes 4,176 structured knowledge atoms, methodology documents organized by Skill, and a high-frequency concept glossary.

- Read the [atom library guide](知识库/原子库/README.md) for data scope and fields.
- Use `知识库/原子库/atoms.jsonl` to build your own RAG.
- Browse the [Skill knowledge packs](知识库/Skill知识包) for the methods.
- Use `/dbs-save`, `/dbs-restore`, and `/dbs-report` for work across conversations. Data stays locally in `~/.dbs/`.
